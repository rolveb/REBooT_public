Are the relevant risks controlled? (Norwegian guideline 2018)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  - Evaluate the *extent of icing*
  - Assess the risk of icethrow/fall
    - Register the use of area that may be exposed to ice throw in the area
    - Who is at risk?
    - *Describe the causal and consequence picture*
       - Relevant initiating events, causes and consequences
       - barriers mitigating the risk, barrier failure
    - *Describe the uncertainty*
      - e.g. likelihood of described event and associated consequence occuring
      - Probability maps
    - Asses the confidence in and the quality of the performed analysis
      - e.g. using strength of knowledge indices: (high/medium/low)
      - e.g. Sensitivity on critical assumptions (NUSAP elements with radar charts)
 - Evaluate the identified risk and acceptance criteria
 - *Assess whether and what measures should be taken*




 
Prevalent approach for ice risk assessments (IEA Wind Task 19 (2018))
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An international expert group has agreed on the required aspects of quantitative ice throw risk assessments


o 1) Mathematical trajectory/calculation model
  - Turbine parameters
     - Hub height
     - Rotor diameter
     - Operational mode
  - Topography
  - Physical parameters
     - Air density
     - Vertical wind profile
     - Radial distribution of ice on blades
     - No. of relevant fragments
     
o 2) Wind and Icing data
  - Wind statistics representative for periods when icing icing and melting may occur
  - Estimation of amount of ice fragments
  
o 3) Risk assessment
  - Probability of Persons present
  - Calculation of risk level
  - Threshold for accepted risk levels
  - Safety measures
  - Consideration of uncertaintes


It is recommended to make realistic assumptions on the input parameters
  - matematical trajectory model
  - wind speed data
  - size and shape of used ice fragments

  - Unless the uncertainty is specified it is recommended to make *conservative assumptions for the following parameters*:
     - Number of ice fragments
     - Likelihold / exposure of people
     - Vulnerability / probit function
     - Threshold for accepted risk level
     - Effectivity of measures

Strength of knowledge judgments
-------------------------------
[NUSAP elements describing uncertainty on e.g. amount of ice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolveb/REBooT_public/main/strength_of_knowledge_judgment/NUSAP_pedigree.py)

Suitable risk mitigation measures in addition to the detailed planning of wind farm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Designed signs
  - Warning routines
  - Possible sound and light signals
  - Direct warning systems (e.g. sms/app)
  - Detection systems
  - Establish public knowledge about the risk
  - Consider physical safeguards and /or curtailment options
    - (e.g. to stop the turbine during periods of particularly high risk).

  - Relocate and mark ski tracks and hiking trails
  - Temporary cordons to prevent traffic during periods of high risk.

Establish public knowlege and sufficient understanding
------------------------------------------------------
  - Signs and warning routines/systems should be supplemented with continuous and effective information transfer that helps the user of the area to understand the specific danger.
     - newspaper articles in local media
     - brochures / information in pocket format that can be distributed
     - QR codes on signs and more comprehensive information boards at the main entrance of the wind power plant.
  - It is an advantage that the information about the risk is correct and effective.
