## Strength of knowledge index
The knowledge is judged as weak if one or more of these conditionsis true:
    - w1) The assumptions made represent strong simplifications.
    - w2) Data/information are/is non-existent or highly unreliable/irrelevant.
    - w3) There is strong disagreement among experts.
    - w4) The phenomena involved are poorly understood; models are non-existent or
    known/believed to give poor predictions.
f, on the other hand, all (whenever they are relevant) of the  following conditions are met, the knowledge is considered strong:
    - s1) The assumptions made are seen as very reasonable.
    - s2) Large amounts of reliable and relevant data/information are available.
    - s3) There is broad agreement among experts.
    - s4) The phenomena involved are well understood; the models used are known to give predictions with the required accuracy.
Alternatively divide into weak, moderate-weak, moderate, moderate-strong, and strong background knowledge

    - 1. If risk is found acceptable according to probability with large margins, the risk is judged as acceptable unless the strength of knowledge is weak (in this case the probability based approach should not be given much weight).
    - 2. If risk is found acceptable according to probability, and the strength of knowledge is strong, the risk is judged as acceptable.
    - 3. If risk is found acceptable according to probability with moderate or small margins, and the strength of knowledge is not strong, the risk is judged as unacceptable and measures are required to reduce risk.
    - 4. If risk is found unacceptable according to probability, the risk is judged as unacceptable and measures are required to reduce risk.


### The judgement on the strength of knowledge can be made according to
the following criteria
 - The reasonability of the assumptions made
 - Amount and relevance of data
 - greement/consensus among experts
 - How well phenomena involved are understood
###  The strength of knowledge can be classified as
 - Poor background knowledge (red)
 - Medium strong background knowledge (yellow)
 - Strong background knowledge (green)
