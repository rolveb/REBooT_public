Strength of knowledge assessment using NUSAP elements

IceRisk 1.0 example:

With NUSAP we are able to provide numerical
statements with considerable nuance of expression.
-  Numerical, Unit, Spread, Assessment, Pedigree
-  A NUSAP element for the uncertainty on the amount of ice
debris thrown from a turbine may look like this list of values
and scores: Numeral, 8.8 tons; Unit, kg/year; Spread,
[7.5tons,10 tons]; Assessment, (High > 90 %
probability/confidence); Pedigree (3,2,3,4). Here, the Pedigree
score are given according to the following table (A) indicating
that the assessment was based on a theoretical model and
calculated data, and that this use is accepted among
colleagues, and colleagues including rebels would bring
consensus regarding the use of the model and calculated data.
