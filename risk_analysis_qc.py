# Methods for performing quality control on IceRisk analyses

## IceRisk related studies and guidelines
For IceRisk analysis the following resources were presented by Rolv Erlend Bredesen at the Winterwind conferences 2018 and 2019. 


[Norwegian guidelines including uncertainty estimates using strenght of knowledge indices and NUSAP elements](https://windren.se/WW2018/03_2_24_Bredesen_Norwegian_guidelines_regarding_the_risk_of_icethrow_for_the_public_Pub_v2_draft.pdf)

The following paper was published in Joournal of Physics - Conference series (2017)

[Understanding and acknowledging the ice throw hazard - consequences for regulatory frameworks, risk perception and risk communication](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/926/1/012001)


The international expert group IEA Wind TCP Task 19 “Wind Energy in Cold Climates” gathers and provides information about wind energy in cold climates. A Guideline on icethrow risk assessments has been published and will be updated in early 2022.

[IEA Wind export group on Wind Energy in Cold climates] (https://iea-wind.org/task19/t19-publications/)

The international Electrotechnical Commision (IEC) is working on a risk assessment standard (due 2022)

[IEC/TS 61400-31 Ed.1.0 Wind energy generation systems - Siting Risk Assessment ](https://www.iec.ch/homepage)


A Drone campaign (winter 2021) for the WEIC project suggests ice pieces within H+D (wind turbine hub height + rotor diameter)  for 4 m/s winds are sufficient. However up to 10 m/s wind speeds were observed after icing episode before drone pictures were taken.

In some cases, an analysis to evaluate a course of action to address a situation focuses on only one “alternative” course of action, or a small set of alternatives that has been defined by some unexamined process or a process external to the analysis. A common wisdom in decision analysis is that often the best way to address a situation is to focus on creating alternatives other than the one or few considered. This AQT is designed to promote a process of examining the  set of alternatives considered to see if one or more  better alternatives can be developed. Of particular concern: Cases where the uncertainty is such that more robust and/or resilient alternatives should be developed, and cases where action-reaction spirals among different parties may lead to unintended consequences.',

This characterization of the basis of knowledge may seem impossibly involved in the general case, but for any particular analysis it is quite feasible and of course should be spelled out.',

Another description of those: Events and scenarios “not on your list.” Some risk management contexts have inconsequetial or extremely improbable Black Swans as the phenomena are well understood and the uncetainties are small. In other contexts, e.g., terrorism, Black Swans can be a driving consideration, since terrorists may deliberately design attacks that are “not on the defender’s list,” Black Swans to the defender.

For example, if the results include bar charts or other formats that present ratiscale data (whether or not the analysts intended  ratio-scale presentation), are those results ratio-scale invariant to metric-allowed variations of the source data? For a specific example from experience: A major model elicited ordinal judgments of probability, then multiplied pairs of those judgments and summed those products into results numbers, presented in scatterplots and bar charts. An analysis with altenative transformations of the original data, shifted by transforms allowable for ordinal metrics, resulted in rank reversals in the bar charts.

In this context by robustness we mean the ability of a system to perform well, without adaptation, when impacted by an attack, accident, or other event. By resilience we mean the ability of a system to respond well or adapt well to an attack, accident, or other event. In both cases, “event” includes any change, disturbance, stressor, etc., both anticipated and unanticipated events. This AQT is crucial, and directly relates to Categories B (Scenarios Not On the List, central reasons for robustness and resilience), F (Proactive Creation of Alternative Courses of Action), and I (Analysis Limitations). At base, here, is the recognition that in many areas, a risk analysis cannot confidently take into consideration all scenarios that could happen.
